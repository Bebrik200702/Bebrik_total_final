    "# Baseline with WildFusion 🦙 🧬\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents an improved baseline for individual identification using the **[MegaDescriptor](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09118)** with **[ALIKED](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03608)** methods, combined using [WildFusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12934).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is WildFusion?  \n",
    "WildFusion is a **feature fusion method** designed to improve the accuracy and robustness of models in individual recognition tasks. Traditional identification models often rely on a single type of feature representation, which may struggle with variations in lighting, angles, and occlusions. WildFusion overcomes these challenges by combining multiple feature extraction techniques, resulting in a more comprehensive and adaptable approach.  "
